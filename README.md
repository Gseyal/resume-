# Basant Seyal Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for a responsive personal website for Basant Seyal, built with plain HTML and styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main single-file HTML application, featuring a responsive design and integrated Tailwind CSS for styling.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `LICENSE`: Contains the full MIT License text.
- `input.md`: An attached markdown file, which would typically contain the primary content (e.g., biography, detailed work, articles) for Basant Seyal. While this HTML does not dynamically parse `input.md`, the site structure is designed to accommodate such content.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **Clean UI**: Modern and minimalist user interface.
- **Easy to Deploy**: A single HTML file makes deployment straightforward.
- **Professional Layout**: Includes sections for About, Work/Projects, and Contact.

## Setup and Usage

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No special build steps or server are required for local viewing.

```bash
open index.html
```

## Customization

- **Content**: Edit `index.html` to update the text in the About, Work, and Contact sections with Basant Seyal's actual information. The `input.md` file is a good place to draft or store this extended content.
- **Styling**: Modify the Tailwind CSS classes directly within `index.html` or integrate a custom Tailwind build process for more advanced styling changes.
- **Images**: Replace placeholder image links with actual images. For example, the profile picture uses a `https://via.placeholder.com` link, which should be updated to a local image file (e.g., `<img src="profile.jpg">`).
